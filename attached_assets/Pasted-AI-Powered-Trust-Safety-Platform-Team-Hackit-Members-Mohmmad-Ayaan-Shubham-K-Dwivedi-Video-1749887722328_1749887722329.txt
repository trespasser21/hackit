a) PROBLEM STATEMENT AND SCOPE OF INNOVATION
Problem Statement:
• Amazon faces challenges with fraudulent sellers, fake reviews, and counterfeit listings
undermining customer trust.
• Manual moderation and traditional rule-based systems are not scalable or adaptive enough
to deal with the sophisticated threats.
Scope of Innovation – “Proof-of-Authenticity Digital-Twin Network”:
We create a Digital-Twin for every high-risk product (electronics, luxury, beauty) and secure its
lifecycle events on a permissioned blockchain. A Digital twin is a virtual representation of a
physical product, tracking its journey and authenticity.
Key elements:
Nano-Tag + Dynamic QR
• Cheap NFC / QR applied to products at factory.
• Each Tag’s unique ID is minted(recorded) on-chain, linked to the product’s SKU
(Stock Keeping Unit) & lot number.
Event Oracle
• IoT scanners log key data like GPS location / time / temperature from third-party logistics(3PL) to
Amazon fulfilment center (FC) to last-mile delivery. (3PL → FC → last-mile)
• Blockchain smart contract updates live authenticity score using the data.
Edge-AI Tamper Vision
• Macro-photo of tag: A driver uses mobile device to capture a close-up photo of a product tag.
• On-device CNN checks micro-pattern: CNN running on device analyses the tag’s unique micropatterns to verify its authenticity or detect tampering.
Customer “Scan-to-Verify”
• Buyer scans QR in Amazon app: Customer scans a QR code on the product using the Amazon
app.
• Views full custody chain, writes final ownership hash: The app displays the product’s complete
history and records the buyer’s ownership on a blockchain.
Anomaly / Recall Radar
• Graph analytics spot diverging sub-chains (grey market): Graph based analytics to detect when
the products deviate from expected supply chain paths.
• Auto takedown + instant recall alert : Automatically remove suspicious listings or issue recall
alert.

Customer Pain Point How Edge-Trust

Everyday Shoppers “Reviews are fake,
can I trust this?”

Honest Sellers Fraud rivals hijack the

1. Edge Review Verifier:
A 5 MB on-device lightweight AI-model (TinyBERT + MobileNet) scores every new review for
authenticity and image originality before it even reaches Amazon servers.
Flags are stored locally and summarized as encrypted, differentially private gradients once/day.
2. Federated Trust Aggregator:
SageMaker Federated Hub collects gradients from millions of devices + FC scanners.
Updates a global model without seeing raw user data.
Produces “review authenticity risk” and “image originality risk” per SKU.
3. Zero-Knowledge Seller Credential (zk-Cred):
Issued by an AWS Nitro-enclave service when a seller uploads KYC + supply-chain docs.
Gives a yes/no proof of:
• Verified identity • Factory origin • No prior counterfeit strike.
Buyers and moderators can verify sellers on their phone in under 20 ms without storing personal
data keeping Amazon compliant with laws like GDPR.
4. Reputation Token & Listing Badge:
ReputationToken = f(edge_risk, zkCred, return_rate, pricing_spikes)
Rendered as a live badge next to “Add to Cart”.
Recomputed every 120 s; collapses to a ‘warning sign’ if token < 0.4.
5. Continual Learning / Drift Guard:
A drift monitor auto-switches to a fresh global model if edge-risk false-positive jumps > 15 %.
Guard rails prevent malicious gradient poisoning via secure aggregation.
SOLUTION KEY COMPONENTS
SUCCESS METRICS & IMPACT
Metric 12-Month Target Impact
Authenticity Scan Rate
≥ 70 % of delivered units scanned
by customers, driven by
in-app prompts and incentives.
Boosts customer trust and
reduces return rates.
Counterfeit Intercept % 90 % of fakes blocked before
delivery Huge reduction in A-to-Z claims
Supply-Chain Breach MTTR < 4 hours to isolate faulty node Faster recalls, less PR damage
Grey-Market Shrink
50 % drop in duplicate tag IDs,
reducing grey-market sales that
undercut MSRP pricing.
Protects MSRP pricing for
brands.
Brand Adoption
1,000 vendors in Year 1, targeting
high-risk categories like electronics
and luxury goods first.
Scales the system, enhancing
platform-wide trust.
STRATEGIC BENEFITS
• Sustainability: Same ledger tracks carbon footprint and cold-chain
integrity, supporting Amazon’s Climate Pledge and ensuring quality for
perishables.
• Buy-Back / Resale: Future trade-in programs can instantly verify
provenance, boosting trust in Amazon Renewed and supporting circular
commerce.
• Insurance Tie-In: Offer device insurance only for products with an
authenticity score ≥ 0.95 (on a 0-1 scale), ensuring low risk of fraud and
creating new revenue streams.
• Edge First → Cloud Later: Tiny models auto-download; slower
connections fall back to server-side scoring, ensuring 99% user
accessibility.
• Cross-Marketplace: Same zk-Cred (digital badge) service can verify
inventory for AWS Marketplace, Kindle eBooks, or grocery tracking.
• International: Privacy tools ensure compliance with global data laws,
avoiding cross-border issues.
• Category Expansion: Easily scales to more high-risk categories like
fashion, protecting more products.
